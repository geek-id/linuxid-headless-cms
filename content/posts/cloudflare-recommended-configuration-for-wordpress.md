# Recommended Cloudflare Configuration for WordPress Users

Cloudflare is a powerful CDN and security platform that can dramatically improve the speed, security, and reliability of your WordPress site. This guide provides a production-ready, step-by-step configuration for WordPress blogs, business sites, and WooCommerce stores.

## Why Use Cloudflare for WordPress?
- **Global CDN**: Faster load times for visitors worldwide
- **DDoS Protection**: Shields your site from attacks
- **SSL/TLS**: Free HTTPS for all sites
- **Caching**: Reduces server load and speeds up delivery
- **Firewall Rules**: Blocks malicious traffic
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic compression and WebP support
- **Bot Management**: Stops bad bots, lets good bots in

## Prerequisites
- A live WordPress site (self-hosted)
- Access to your domain DNS settings
- Free Cloudflare account ([Sign up here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up))

## Step 1: Add Your Site to Cloudflare
1. Sign in to Cloudflare and click **Add a Site**
2. Enter your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
3. Choose the **Free** plan (or higher if needed)
4. Cloudflare will scan your DNS recordsâ€”review and confirm
5. Update your domain's nameservers to the ones provided by Cloudflare
6. Wait for DNS propagation (usually minutes to a few hours)

## Step 2: Essential DNS & Security Settings
- **A Record**: Points to your server's IP
- **CNAME**: For `www` and other subdomains
- **Mail (MX) Records**: Set to DNS only (not proxied)
- **Proxy Status**: Orange cloud (proxied) for web traffic, gray cloud (DNS only) for mail/FTP
- **DNSSEC**: Enable for DNS security

## Step 3: SSL/TLS Best Practices
- **SSL Mode**: Always use **Full (Strict)** for maximum security (never use Flexible)
- **Origin Certificates**: Use Cloudflare Origin Certificates or a public CA (e.g., Let's Encrypt)
- **Always Use HTTPS**: ON
- **Automatic HTTPS Rewrites**: Enable only if you have mixed content; otherwise, disable for performance
- **HSTS**: Enable for extra security (advanced users)
- **TLS 1.3**: ON
- **Minimum TLS Version**: Set to 1.2 or higher

## Step 4: Speed & Performance Optimization
- **Speed Observatory**: Enable daily testing to monitor performance
- **Image Optimization**:
  - **Polish**: Enable for image compression unless you already serve WebP/AVIF from origin
  - **Mirage**: Enable for mobile/image-heavy sites
- **Protocol Optimization**:
  - **HTTP/2 & HTTP/3**: Enable both
  - **HTTP/2 to Origin**: Enable if your origin supports it
  - **Enhanced HTTP/2 Prioritization**: Enable for optimal resource delivery
  - **Brotli Compression**: ON
  - **0-RTT Connection Resumption**: ON
- **Tiered Cache Topology**: Enable for global audiences
- **Argo Smart Routing**: Consider enabling for international traffic (paid feature)
- **Auto Minify**: Enable for JavaScript, CSS, HTML
- **Rocket Loader**: Test with your theme/plugins; disable if you see JS issues or use modern JS frameworks
- **Development Mode**: Use only when making changes to your site

## Step 5: Caching & Rules
- **Caching Level**: Standard
- **Browser Cache TTL**: 1 day (or longer for static sites)
- **Always Online**: ON
- **Purge Cache**: After major updates or theme/plugin changes
- **Page Rules / New Rulesets**: Use new rulesets for fine-tuned caching and security (Page Rules are being phased out)
  - **Cache Everything for Static Assets**: `/wp-content/*` (Cache Level: Cache Everything, Edge Cache TTL: 1 month)
  - **Bypass Cache for Admin and Login**: `/wp-admin*`, `/wp-login.php*` (Cache Level: Bypass)
  - **Bypass Cache for WooCommerce**: `/cart*`, `/checkout*`, `/my-account*` (Cache Level: Bypass)
  - **Always Use HTTPS**: `/*` (Always Use HTTPS)

## Step 6: Firewall & Security
- **WAF (Web Application Firewall)**: ON (Free plan includes basic rules)
- **WordPress-specific rules**: Enable OWASP and WordPress rulesets
- **Custom WAF Rules for WordPress**:
  - Block access to sensitive paths unless referer is your own site:
    ```
    (http.request.uri.path in {"/wp-register.php" "/wp-admin/" "/install.php" "/theme-editor.php" "/wp-config.php" "/backup/" "/wp-backup/" "/upgrade.php" "/xmlrpc.php"} and not http.referer contains "yourdomain.com")
    ```
  - Country filtering and login protection:
    ```
    (ip.geoip.country in {"XX" "YY"} and cf.threat_score ge 5) or (http.request.uri.path contains "/wp-login.php")
    ```
    Replace `XX`, `YY` with country codes as needed.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect login and XML-RPC endpoints
- **Bot Fight Mode**: ON
- **Browser Integrity Check**: ON
- **Challenge suspicious countries/IPs**: Optional, for extra security

## Step 7: WordPress Plugin Settings
- **Cloudflare Official Plugin**: Install and connect to your account
- **Automatic Cache Purge**: Enable for post/page updates
- **APO (Automatic Platform Optimization)**: Highly recommended for best performance (paid feature)

## Step 8: Best Practices & Troubleshooting
- **Test your site** after each change
- **Check Cloudflare Analytics** for traffic and threat reports
- **Use Development Mode** when making design changes
- **Purge cache** if you see outdated content
- **Review Firewall Events** for blocked requests
- **Disable Rocket Loader** if you see JS issues or use modern JS frameworks
- **Regularly review and update your rules and settings** as Cloudflare evolves

## Advanced Tips
- **Custom Firewall Rules**: Block XML-RPC, restrict admin by IP
- **Workers**: Use for advanced edge logic (paid feature)
- **Log real visitor IPs**: Configure your server to restore original IPs from Cloudflare headers
- **Monitor uptime**: Use Cloudflare's free monitoring or third-party tools
- **Fail2Ban Integration**: Use Fail2Ban with Cloudflare API for automated blocking

## Conclusion
With these recommended Cloudflare settings, your WordPress site will be faster, more secure, and more reliable. Adjust settings as needed for your specific plugins, themes, and business needs.
