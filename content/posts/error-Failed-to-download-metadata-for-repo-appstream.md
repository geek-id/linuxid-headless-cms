After successfully installing CentOS 8 on our Cloud VPS and running it for an extended period without updates, we encountered an error when attempting to perform a system update:

```bash
[root@linux-id.net ~]# yum update
CentOS Linux 8 - AppStream                                                 265  B/s |  38  B     00:00
Error: Failed to download metadata for repo 'appstream': Cannot prepare internal mirrorlist: No URLs in mirrorlist
```

This error message indicates that the repository mirrorlist URLs have become unreachable. The root cause is that **CentOS 8 reached End of Life (EOL) on December 31, 2021**, meaning the CentOS Project no longer provides updates or support for this version.

## Understanding CentOS 8 End of Life

### What Happened to CentOS 8?

CentOS 8 was originally scheduled to receive support until 2029, following the traditional 10-year lifecycle. However, in December 2020, Red Hat announced a significant shift in the CentOS project strategy:

- **CentOS 8 EOL accelerated** to December 31, 2021
- **Focus shifted to CentOS Stream**, a rolling-release distribution
- **Traditional CentOS Linux discontinued** in favor of the upstream development model

### Impact on Existing Systems

When CentOS 8 reached EOL:
- All official mirrors stopped hosting CentOS 8 packages
- Security updates and bug fixes ceased
- Repository metadata became inaccessible
- Systems could no longer receive updates through standard channels

## Solution: Migrating to Vault Repositories

To resolve the repository error and continue using CentOS 8 (though not recommended for production), you can redirect your repositories to the archived vault.centos.org:

### Method 1: Quick Repository Fix

**Step 1:** Navigate to the repository configuration directory
```bash
cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
```

**Step 2:** Comment out the mirrorlist entries
```bash
sed -i 's/mirrorlist/#mirrorlist/g' /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-*
```

**Step 3:** Enable and update baseurl to point to vault
```bash
sed -i 's|#baseurl=http://mirror.centos.org|baseurl=http://vault.centos.org|g' /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-*
```

**Step 4:** Clean cache and update
```bash
yum clean all
yum update -y
```

### Method 2: Manual Repository Configuration

For more control, manually edit each repository file:

```bash
# Edit each repository file individually
vi /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Linux-BaseOS.repo
vi /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Linux-AppStream.repo
vi /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Linux-Extras.repo
```

In each file, modify the configuration:
```ini
[baseos]
name=CentOS Linux $releasever - BaseOS
#mirrorlist=http://mirrorlist.centos.org/?release=$releasever&arch=$basearch&repo=BaseOS&infra=$infra
baseurl=http://vault.centos.org/8.5.2111/BaseOS/$basearch/os/
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-centosofficial
```

### Method 3: Using Alternative Mirrors

Some community mirrors still host CentOS 8 packages:

```bash
# Example using a community mirror
sed -i 's|#baseurl=http://mirror.centos.org|baseurl=http://archive.kernel.org/centos-vault|g' /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-*
```

## Migration Strategies for Production Systems

### Immediate Actions Required

**⚠️ Security Warning:** Using EOL CentOS 8 in production poses significant security risks due to lack of security updates.

### Recommended Migration Paths

#### 1. **CentOS Stream 8** (Short-term)
- Rolling-release model
- Upstream for RHEL 8
- **Note:** CentOS Stream 8 also reached EOL on May 31, 2024

```bash
# Convert to CentOS Stream 8 (if still available)
dnf install centos-release-stream
dnf distro-sync
```

#### 2. **Rocky Linux 8** (Recommended)
- Community-driven RHEL clone
- Binary-compatible with RHEL 8
- Long-term support

```bash
# Migration using migrate2rocky script
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rocky-linux/rocky-tools/main/migrate2rocky/migrate2rocky.sh
chmod +x migrate2rocky.sh
./migrate2rocky.sh -r
```

#### 3. **AlmaLinux 8** (Alternative)
- Another RHEL-compatible distribution
- Backed by CloudLinux

```bash
# Migration using almalinux-deploy script
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlmaLinux/almalinux-deploy/master/almalinux-deploy.sh
chmod +x almalinux-deploy.sh
./almalinux-deploy.sh
```

#### 4. **RHEL 8** (Enterprise)
- Official Red Hat Enterprise Linux
- Commercial support available
- Free for development use

```bash
# Convert using convert2rhel tool
subscription-manager register
dnf install convert2rhel
convert2rhel
```

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue 1: GPG Key Errors
```bash
# Import CentOS GPG keys
rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-centosofficial
```

#### Issue 2: Dependency Conflicts
```bash
# Force package downgrade if needed
yum downgrade package-name
# Or skip broken packages
yum update --skip-broken
```

#### Issue 3: Repository Priority Conflicts
```bash
# Install yum priorities plugin
yum install yum-plugin-priorities
# Configure repository priorities in .repo files
```

### Verification Steps

After fixing repositories, verify the configuration:

```bash
# Check repository status
yum repolist
yum repoinfo

# Verify package availability
yum check-update

# Test package installation
yum install -y vim
```

## Best Practices for Future Migrations

### 1. **Proactive Planning**
- Monitor EOL schedules for your distributions
- Plan migrations 6-12 months before EOL
- Test migration procedures in development environments

### 2. **Backup Strategy**
- Create full system backups before migration
- Document current system configuration
- Test backup restoration procedures

### 3. **Staged Migration**
- Migrate non-critical systems first
- Validate application compatibility
- Plan maintenance windows for production systems

### 4. **Alternative Distributions**
Consider distributions with longer support cycles:
- **Ubuntu LTS**: 5-year support cycle
- **RHEL**: 10-year lifecycle
- **SUSE Linux Enterprise**: 13-year support
- **Debian**: ~5-year support cycle

## Container and Cloud Considerations

### Container Images
Update container base images to supported distributions:

```dockerfile
# Replace CentOS 8 base images
# FROM centos:8
FROM rockylinux:8
# or
FROM almalinux:8
```

### Cloud Instances
- Update AMIs/images to supported distributions
- Use infrastructure as code for consistent deployments
- Implement automated patching for security updates

## Conclusion

The CentOS 8 EOL represents a significant shift in the enterprise Linux landscape. While the vault.centos.org solution provides temporary access to packages, it should only be used as a short-term measure for non-production systems.

**Key Takeaways:**
1. **Immediate action required** for CentOS 8 systems in production
2. **Multiple migration paths available** (Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, RHEL)
3. **Security risks** of running EOL systems without updates
4. **Importance of proactive planning** for future EOL events

For production environments, we strongly recommend migrating to a supported distribution like Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux, which provide binary compatibility with RHEL 8 and ongoing security updates. The migration tools available make this process relatively straightforward, and the long-term benefits far outweigh the short-term effort required.
